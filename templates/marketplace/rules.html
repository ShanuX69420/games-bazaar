        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Sometimes our system will let you join Discord voice chat for certain sales. But you still can't exchange personal contact info or add each other as friends - that's still against the rules.</p>

        <p>If you want to work with another seller on orders together, contact our support team first.</p>

        <p>Our staff might test sellers by pretending to be regular buyers to make sure everyone follows the rules.</p>

        <p>We can reduce or remove punishments if we think they don't fit the situation.</p>
