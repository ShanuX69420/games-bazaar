# Security Fixes Applied

## Critical Security Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. CSRF Protection on Payment Endpoints
**Issue:** Payment endpoints had `@csrf_exempt` decorator, allowing CSRF attacks
**Fix:** 
- Removed CSRF exemption from `jazzcash_payment()` endpoint
- Enhanced `jazzcash_callback()` with additional security validation:
  - Request size validation (10KB limit)
  - Bot detection
  - Signature verification as primary security control
- Fixed function indentation issues

**Files Modified:** 
- `marketplace/views.py` (lines 1251, 1302-1327)

### 2. IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References) Vulnerabilities
**Issues:** 
- Order details fetched before authorization check
- Conversation access not properly validated

**Fix:**
- `order_detail()`: Authorization check now happens BEFORE fetching order details
- `report_dispute()`: Added database-level participant validation using Q objects

**Files Modified:** 
- `marketplace/views.py` (lines 703-711, 1597-1606)

### 3. Input Validation and Bounds Checking
**Issue:** Quantity validation had no upper bounds - potential for integer overflow

**Fix:**
- Created `validate_quantity()` function with proper bounds (max 100)
- Applied to all quantity input locations (3 places)
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

**Files Modified:**
- `marketplace/views.py` (lines 26-39, 671, 1282, 1582)

## High Priority Issues Fixed ✅

### 4. Rate Limiting Implementation
**Issue:** No rate limiting on critical endpoints

**Fix:**
- Created `check_rate_limit()` function using Django cache
- Applied to:
  - Message sending: 30/minute
  - Order creation: 10/hour
- Uses IP + User ID combination for accurate limiting

**Files Modified:**
- `marketplace/views.py` (lines 83-113, 1232, 1666)

### 5. Secure File Upload Handling
**Issue:** Insufficient file validation allowing potential malicious uploads

**Fix:**
- Created `validate_uploaded_file()` function with:
  - File size validation (5MB limit for products, 3MB for chat)
  - MIME type validation
  - File extension validation
  - Magic byte validation for images
- Applied to all file upload endpoints:
  - Product images
  - Chat images
  - Profile pictures

**Files Modified:**
- `marketplace/views.py` (lines 41-81, 621-626, 661-665, 1213-1216)

### 6. Comprehensive Error Handling
**Issue:** Potential information disclosure through error messages

**Fix:**
- Created `SecurityMiddleware` with:
  - Request validation for suspicious patterns
  - Bot detection and blocking
  - Secure exception handling
  - Security logging

**Files Created:**
- `marketplace/security_middleware.py`

**Files Modified:**
- `core/settings/production.py` (added middleware)

### 7. Security Headers Implementation
**Issue:** Missing security headers

**Fix:**
- Added security headers via middleware:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
  - `Permissions-Policy` (restrictive)
  - `Content-Security-Policy` (basic)

**Files Modified:**
- `marketplace/security_middleware.py`

### 8. Input Sanitization
**Issue:** User content not sanitized for XSS prevention

**Fix:**
- Created `sanitize_user_input()` function:
  - Removes script tags
  - Removes dangerous attributes
  - Removes control characters
  - Length limiting
- Applied to message content

**Files Modified:**
- `marketplace/views.py` (lines 115-140, 1271)

## Testing Status ✅

### Syntax Validation

*Note: Additional recommendations below

## Additional Recommendations for Enhanced Security

### 1. Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Consider CloudFlare or AWS WAF for additional protection
- DDoS protection and advanced bot detection

### 2. Security Monitoring
- Implement security event logging
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- Regular security audit logs review

### 3. Regular Security Updates
- Keep Django and dependencies updated
- Regular security vulnerability scanning
- Periodic penetration testing

### 4. Database Security
- Regular database backups
- Encrypted connections
- Database user privilege separation

### 5. SSL/TLS Configuration
- Use strong SSL ciphers
- HSTS preload list enrollment
- Certificate transparency monitoring

## Deployment Checklist
